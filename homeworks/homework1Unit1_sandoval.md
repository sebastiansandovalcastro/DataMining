# PAIR CODING

## What is pair coding?

Pair coding, better known as pair programming, consists of two programmers who share the same workstation to code.

The person who is in charge of programming is known as a “driver” and the other person, who is in charge of directing the work, is known as a “navigator” (or navigator, although he is also known as an observer).

It should be noted that these two roles take turns from time to time so that the two programmers carry out both the programming activity and supervising the other's work.

## What is the purpose of using pair coding?

The use of pair programming seeks to ensure the quality of the final product, where there is greater certainty that an optimal result has been reached and as many errors as possible have been avoided thanks to constant supervision during development.

It is thought that this working technique is more efficient thanks to the fact that the union of two people in the same project keeps coding errors in a lower range, there is a greater speed in solving problems and, in addition, it is a method effective when it comes to sharing knowledge.

## Pair coding VS. Code reviews

It is very common to find comparisons between programming in pairs and the well-known code reviews (or code reviews). The effectiveness of this technique (pair coding) in software development is frequently questioned and it is hinted many times that it can result in a simple waste of time.

The truth is that, when analyzing well the position that pair programming has within this comparison, it can seem at first glance a somewhat vague technique. The truth is that having two people working on the same code brings with it many more advantages than letting one person analyze the post-development result.

A person outside the development process, in order to correct possible coding errors, needs time to adapt to the reasoning of the programmer. Instead, two people who work on the same problem, build the code in their own way as the development progresses, so that the final product is understandable for both, in addition to that in the same development, instant reviews are made, regularly and constantly.

## Conclusion

I honestly consider that, although pair programming may have certain blind spots and depends a lot on the circumstances, it turns out to be a promising technique if what you are looking for is to reach a competent result. In the same way, this technique results in a good opportunity to learn other forms of programming, acquire new knowledge of the field and, of course, to work with other people in search of a common goal.
