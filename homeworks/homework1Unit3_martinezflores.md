# HOMEWORK 1 - WHAT IS MACHINE LEARNING? (MARTINEZ FLORES)

**1. What is machine learning?**
Machine Learning is an artificial intelligence application that gives systems the ability to automatically learn and improve the experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on developing software that can access data and use it to learn for themselves. 
The learning process begins with observations on the data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to find patterns in the data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples we provide. The main goal is to allow computers to automatically learn without intervention or human assistance and adjust actions accordingly. 

**2. Where is machine learning used?**
Intelligent systems based on machine learning algorithms have the ability to learn from experiences or history in data. Below are mentioned where machine learning is applied: 
- Image recognition
- Voice recognition
- Medical diagnosis
- Statistical arbitration 
- Learning associations
- Classification
- Prediction
- Extraction
- Regression
- Financial services

**3. What is linear regression for?**
The mathematical model of linear regression is continuously used in disciplines such as sociology, biomedicine, economics, engineering, etc. 

Its main function is to find linear relationship between two variables to analyze the relationship or dependence between the variables studied. 

Graphically all this can be captured by a scatter plot (point cloud) with its corresponding straight adjusted.

**4. Explain your observations of the linear regression plot generated in R**
Based on the graph obtained in Simple Linear Regression practice, we can see how the variables are related and although these points are scattered on the plane they are attached to the plotted line. This means that the more years of experience you have, there is the possibility of a pay increase.
