# GRAMMAR OF GRAPHICS

## What is the grammar of graphics?

The graph grammar is a framework that follows a layered approach to describing and constructing visualizations or graphs in a structured way. A visualization that involves multidimensional data often has multiple components or aspects, and taking advantage of this layered graphics grammar allows you to describe and understand each component involved in the visualization, in terms of data, aesthetics, scale, objects, etc.

The original grammar of the graphical framework was proposed by Leland Wilkinson, which covers all the main aspects related to the effective visualization of data in detail.

## Components of the grammar of graphs

**1. Data:** it is the data that is going to be plotted and presented, identifying the dimensions to be visualized.

**2. Aesthetics:** it is the establishment of the axes based on the dimensions of the data as well as the position of the data points on the graph. The aesthetics of the visualization are verified in fields such as the size of the data when graphing them, their shape, color, etc.

**3. Scale:** is the scale of the values ​​presented visually according to the range of data used, the specificity to be transmitted, what they represent, etc.

**4. Geometric objects:** it is the way in which the data is intended to be represented, so that it adjusts to the type of information that is being presented, since not all the forms fit. They can be points, bars, lines, etc.

**5. Statistics:** these are the statistical measures that exist in the visualization when they are required. They can be measures of central tendency, dispersion, confidence intervals, etc.

**6. Facets:** are all those sub-frames based on specific data dimensions, representing a specific set in a special way.

**7. Coordinate system:** are the coordinate systems used to represent the information. They can be cartesian planes, polar planes, etc.

## Conclusion

The presentation of information also has a structure and an order, seeking the purpose of transmitting a specific message.

For a better result, it can be concluded that it is necessary to thoroughly analyze the information that is available and follow a structural order when designing the visualization that is planned to be exposed to obtain a visualization that is easier to understand.
