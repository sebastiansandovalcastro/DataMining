# HOMEWORK 1 - WHAT IS THE GRAMMAR OF THE GRAPHICS? (MARTINEZ FLORES)

### GRAMMAR OF GRAPHS 

_"A graph, graphical representation, or graph is a type of data representation, usually quantitative, using visual resources (lines, vectors, surfaces, or symbols), so that the mathematical relationship or statistical correlation they hold with each other is visually manifested."_

A graphics grammar is a framework that follows a layered approach to describing and constructing visualizations or charts in a structured way.

A visualization involving multidimensional data often has multiple components or aspects, and leveraging this grammar in chart layers helps us describe and understand each component involved in visualization – in terms of data, aesthetics, scale, objects, and so on.

The original grammar of the graphic framework was proposed by Leland Wilkinson, which covers all the main aspects related to effective data visualization in detail.
