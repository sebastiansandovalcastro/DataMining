# MACHINE LEARNING

## What is machine learning?

Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence that provides systems with the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn by themselves.

The learning process begins with observations in the data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in the data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples we provide.

The main goal is to allow computers to learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and to adjust actions accordingly.

## Where the machine learning is used?

Intelligent systems based on machine learning algorithms have the ability to learn from experiences or history in data. The following fields are where machine learning is applied:

- Image recognition
- Speech recognition
- Medical diagnostic
- Statistical arbitration
- Learning partnerships
- Classification
- Prediction
- Extraction
- Regression
- Financial services

## What is linear regression for?

The linear regression mathematical model is used continuously in disciplines such as sociology, biomedicine, economics, engineering, etc.

Its main function is to find a linear relationship between two variables to analyze the relationship or dependency between the variables studied.

Graphically all this can be captured by means of a scatter diagram (cloud of points) with its corresponding fitted line.

## Observations of the linear regression plot generated in R

Analyzing the graph obtained, it is clearly seen how the variables are related and how these, despite not being attached to the line that runs through the graph, are slightly attracted to it, concentrating all on its path.

## Conclusion

Machine learning may seem like something quite complicated and futuristic, but in reality it is something that is constantly present in the day to day of the days in which we live today.
